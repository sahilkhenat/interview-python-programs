# Interview Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs commonly used in technical interviews, aimed at helping Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) prepare for coding assessments. Each program addresses a specific problem or concept frequently encountered during interviews.

## Easy
- HelloWorld: This program simply prints "Hello World", the first and most basic program. 
- Reverse: This program returns the reversed string of the input string provided.
- Palindrome: This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same backward as forward.
- MathsOperations: This program performs basic maths operations on two given numbers like add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- Average : This program takes input as list of numbers and returns average of given list of numbers
- LeapYear : This program takes input as a year and returns if it is a leap year or not
- EvenOdd : This program takes input as a number and returns if it is even or odd
- Factorial : This program takes input a number and returns its factorial
- Fibonacci :
- Find Length of Number :
- CountVowels and Consonants:
- Find Maximum and Minimum : This program takes a list of numbers and returns maximum and minimum numbers 
- Positive or Negative : This program takes input as a number and returns if it is positive or negative
- SwapWithoutThirdVariable : This program takes input as two numbers and swaps values without using third temporary variable
- Fibonacci: This program takes input from the user as a number N and displays the Fibonacci series until the Nth term.

## Medium
- Factorial of List: This program takes input as list of numbers and  returns the factorial of each number.
- Anagram : This program takes input as two strings and returns if they are anagrams. eg: TEAR and RATE are anagrams.
- CalculateArea : This program takes input as shape name, its dimension needed to calculate area and returns the area in square units.
- CalculateOccurrences : This program takes input as a list and returns occurrences of each item in list
- Find maximum without comparison operator : This program takes input as two numbers and returns maximum of both without using comparison operator
- Find Duplicate in List : This program takes input as a list and returns if duplicate values in the list if any
- Perfect number : This program takes input as a number and returns if it is a perfect number. eg - If sum of divisors is equal to the number itself then it is perfect number.  6 = 1+2+3
- Prime number : This program takes input as  a number and returns if it is a prime number or not
- Sum of Digits : This program takes input as a number and returns the sum of its digits
- Unit converter : This program converts distance and temperature. Distance-KM to Miles, Miles to KM, Temperature - Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Linear search: This program takes input as a list of numbers, a target number to perform linear search and then returns indices at which the target is present in list 
- Binary search : This program takes input as a list of numbers, a target number to perform binary search on a sorted array to find the target value.
